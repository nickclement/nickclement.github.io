		<h1> <center> Players with Concussion History </h1> </center> 
		<p> Many players complain that the NFL is not doing enough to protect them against brain altering hits that may lead to CTE symptoms. In November 2011, the Cleveland Clinic Center for Spine Health conducted a study in which different helmets were compared with each other on crash test dummies. It was found that leather helmets provided similar results to modern helmets, and in some cases, the leather helmets proved to have superior protection against concussive hits. This says alot about the effort the NFL puts in to truly protect their players.</p>
		
		</p> On September 30, 2014, researchers with Boston University announced that in autopsies of 79 brains of former NFL players, 76 had tested positive for CTE. One of these players was one of my favorite players Junior Seau. Seau was always seen a family man, loved by all. He has 3 sons, a daughter and a loving wife. During his retirement, his family recalls sudden mood changes, a distant feeling, and spontaneous leaving of the house for long periods of time. In May of 2012, Seau was found dead, cause of death being a self inflicted gunshot wound to the chest. After his death, his family donated his brain to neuroscientist where they immediately found traces of CTE. He passed at the age of 43. </p>

		<h2> CTE Causing Violence </h2>
		<p> On December 1st, 2012, Jovan Belcher, a current member of the Kansas City Chiefs shot and killed his fiance 9 times before shooting himself in the parking lot of the Chiefs Practice field, right in front of 3 of his coaches. An autopsy showed signs of CTE in Belcher, and multiple friends reported a spike in aggression and fighting with the people who surrounded him.</p>
		<hr/>
		<p>CTE is clearly causing harm to several people playing football. Some coaches are basing their draft picks on history of concussions in college players, and while the NFL is trying to reduce the amount of concussions, there has recently been a 31% spike in the 2015 season. </p>
