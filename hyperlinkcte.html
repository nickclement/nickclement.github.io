		<h1> <center> Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) </center> </h1> 
	<p> Once a disease that was believed to exist primarily among boxers, CTE is a serious disease that affects the brain of people who experience repeated blows to the head, concussions, and brain injuries.</p> 
	<p> The brain of a CTE victim gradually deteriorates and loses mass over time, and in some cases areas of the brain become enlarged. Areas of the brain build up "tau protien", a substance which serves to stabilize cellular structure, but which may become defective and cause major problems in the function of neurons. </p>

		<h2> Symptoms of CTE </h2> 
		
		CTE is a major life changing disease for both the victim and their families. Most commonly and first seen are loss of memory, bi-polar like personalities, irregular judgement and erratic depression or aggression. Major symptoms in the long run have been recently studied and confirmed they relate to symptoms of dimentia, Alzheimers, and Parkinsons disease. Some of the worst cases have seen thoughts of/ actions of suicide.
