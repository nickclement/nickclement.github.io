		<h1> <center> NFLs "attempts" to Reduce Head Blows </h1> </center>
		<p> The NFL first began to review concussions formally in 1994, then NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue created the Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (MTBI) Committee, that studies the effects of concussions in NFL players. Tagliabue appointed rheumatologist Elliot Pellman to chair the committee. Many did not like this appointment because he is not a certified neurologist and often admitted ignorance about head injuries.</p>
		<p>The data collected by the league from 1996 to 2001 was proven to incorrectly show the actual number of diagnosed concussions by 10%. In an ESPN Magazine article titled "Doctor Yes," Peter Keating called out Pellman and the MTBI committee and said "The committee has drawn a number of important conclusions about head trauma and how to treat it that contradict the research and experiences of many other doctors who treat sports concussions, not to mention the players who have suffered them."</p>

		<h2> Lawsuits </h2>
		<p> In August 2012, the number of players involved in lawsuits against the NFL increased to 3,402, and the League sued 34 insurance companies attempting to force them to cover the costs of defending claims of not protecting players. Clearly something needed to be done, and luckily the NFL came to an agreement, unfortunatly with several holes.</p>
		<P> The agreement was reached on August 29, 2013. Under the agreement, the NFL contributed $765 million to provide medical help to more than 18,000 former NFL players. Retired players who suffer from brain related injuries and defects such as Alzheimer's, and ALS diseases in the future will also be eligible. In addition, $10 million was funded into brain injury research and programs to further educate young and current football players across the country.</P>
		<hr/>
		<p> The fact that the NFL neglects head injuries stirs up alot of questions. Are they preserving money? Ratings? Why would the oganization not try and protect their employees from these horrible diseases that cause such drastic actions and changes. Some of these need to be answered.
